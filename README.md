Juke: An Audiovisual Universe

## Demo
Demo the game here: [dannygr664.github.io/juke](https://dannygr664.github.io/juke)

## Running the game locally
To run the game locally, navigate to the `docs` directory, and spin up a local server on your machine to host the code. To accomplish this, the author recommends the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, which integrates easily with the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Then connect to `localhost:<port number>` in your favorite web browser. Please note that MIDI controller input is only supported in Google Chrome.
